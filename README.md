# framework
Xeptix Framework is a ROBLOX Plugin which completely reinvents the Roblox API, extending it tenfold adding many useful features. The framework was coded efficiently and carefully by Xeptix and features code from AxisAngle, Crazyman32, and other popular scripters.

The framework converts all instances into a custom instance that has a widely extended API, without interrupting or otherwise breaking your code. You can place the framework into an already existing game and use our extended API conflict-free!

Usage is simple, check out the [offical Wiki](https://github.com/Xeptix/framework/wiki "Xeptix Framework Wiki") for detailed documentation on all additional API the framework provides, along with usage examples!
